# plotly

### Code written by Nele Reynier and presented to the UEA Scientific Python group

The [original post](https://ueapy.github.io/an-overview-of-the-plotly-library-for-making-interactive-plots.html) on our website wasn't rendering nicely so I've binderised the notebook. To view (and interact with) Nele's notebook:
1. Follow the binder link below
2. Click on the file `2019-11-26-intro-to-plotly.ipynb`
3. In the top menu bar click `kernel` >> `restart and run all`
